# NordicNuclearAnalysis

This repository contains the code and data used in the analysis of the Nordic Power System as part of the Master's 
Thesis conducted by the Department of Electric Energy at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology 
([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/iel)).

The different case studies represent the Nordic Power System in different scenarios, such as the current state, 
the future state with or without nuclear power, and the future state with different levels of nuclear power.

Each case folder contains the following files:
- A main script that runs the analysis and generates the results.
- A data folder containing the input data.
- A results folder containing the output data.

The functions folder contains:
- The global functions used in the analysis.
- The database functions used to extract the data from the database.
